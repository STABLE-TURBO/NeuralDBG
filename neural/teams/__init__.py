"""
Multi-tenancy and team management module (removed).

This module has been removed to simplify the codebase.
Only essential RBAC and team management features are retained
if actively used by core features.

Since teams functionality was not actively used by core features
(parser, code generation, shape propagation), it has been removed entirely.
