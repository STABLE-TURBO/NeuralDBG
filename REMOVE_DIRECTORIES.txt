# Directories to Remove for v0.4.0 Refocusing

The following directories need to be removed as they are out of scope for the focused v0.4.0 release:

## Already Removed (via git rm):
- neural/cost/ ✓
- neural/monitoring/ ✓
- neural/profiling/ ✓
- neural/docgen/ ✓

## Need Manual Removal:
- neural/teams/
- neural/marketplace/ (may not be tracked)
- neural/mlops/
- neural/data/
- neural/collaboration/ (may not be tracked)
- neural/federated/ (may not be tracked)
- neural/config/
- neural/education/
- neural/plugins/
- neural/explainability/

## Commands to Remove Remaining Directories:

### Using PowerShell (Windows):
```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force neural/teams, neural/mlops, neural/data, neural/config, neural/education, neural/plugins, neural/explainability
```

### Using Bash (Linux/Mac):
```bash
rm -rf neural/teams neural/marketplace neural/mlops neural/data neural/collaboration neural/federated neural/config neural/education neural/plugins neural/explainability
```

### Using Git (if tracked):
```bash
git rm -rf neural/teams neural/mlops neural/data neural/config neural/education neural/plugins neural/explainability
```

## Note:
Some directories (marketplace, collaboration, federated) may not be tracked in git and can be safely deleted with regular file system commands.

## Verification:
After removal, the following core directories should remain:
- neural/ai/ (AI-powered DSL generation - retained)
- neural/api/ (may be removed if not core)
- neural/aquarium/ (may be removed if not core)
- neural/automl/ (AutoML - retained as optional feature)
- neural/benchmarks/ (may be removed if redundant)
- neural/cli/ (CLI - retained, simplified)
- neural/cloud/ (cloud integration - may be retained for Colab/Kaggle support)
- neural/code_generation/ (core)
- neural/dashboard/ (debugging dashboard - retained)
- neural/execution_optimization/ (may be redundant)
- neural/hpo/ (HPO - retained as optional feature)
- neural/integrations/ (base classes - retained)
- neural/metrics/ (metrics computation - retained)
- neural/no_code/ (may be removed)
- neural/parser/ (core)
- neural/pretrained_models/ (may be retained)
- neural/security/ (security utilities - retained)
- neural/shape_propagation/ (core)
- neural/src/ (check contents)
- neural/templates/ (templates - retained)
- neural/tracking/ (experiment tracking - may be retained)
- neural/training/ (training utilities - retained)
- neural/utils/ (utilities - retained)
- neural/visualization/ (visualization - retained)
