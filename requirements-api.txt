# This file is no longer used - API module has been removed as per v0.4.0
# The API server was removed as part of refocusing on core DSL functionality
# 
# Alternative approaches:
# - Use the CLI: neural compile, neural run, neural debug, etc.
# - Use the unified server: neural server (for dashboard, no-code builder, monitoring)
# - Build custom REST API: Wrap Neural in FastAPI/Flask for your specific needs
#
# If you need API dependencies for custom integration:
# pip install fastapi uvicorn
