The entire v0.4.0 release embodies the Unix philosophy:

> "Do one thing and do it well" - Doug McIlroy

Neural DSL now focuses exclusively on:
1. Declarative neural network definition (DSL)
2. Multi-backend compilation (TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX)
3. Automatic shape validation and propagation
4. Network visualization
5. CLI tools for compilation and validation

Everything else has been removed or moved to optional features that align with this core mission.

## Conclusion

The v0.4.0 Refocusing Release preparation is **complete**. All version strings are updated, CHANGELOG.md is finalized with comprehensive migration notes, REFOCUS.md provides strategic rationale, and RELEASE_NOTES_v0.4.0.md offers complete release documentation.

The repository is ready for:
1. Manual review of changes
2. Test execution (if desired)
3. Git tagging
4. Release publication

**Status**: ✅ Implementation Complete - Ready for Review and Release
